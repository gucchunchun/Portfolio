I started learning Astro a week ago for making portfolio website for myself.
For the starter, I used [onWidgets](https://onwidget.com/)'s template to know what Astro is like.


```
components/
├── common/
├── ui/
└── widgets/
└── Logo.astro
└── Some other components...
```

This is what I got as template.
Apparently `common/` had scripts files used in base layout file and some specific component with optimization functionality such as Image components and `ui/` had reusable components.

I understood the structure, but did not really like it.

That is why I decided to re-structure it to make my own template.

## Final Folder Structure

### `components` Directory

```
components/
├── common/
├── features/
└── layouts/
```

1. common/
- Reusable UI elements shared across multiple parts of your app.
2. features/
- Feature-specific or domain-specific components that implement more focused functionality.
3. layouts/
- Structural or “shell” components that wrap pages or large sections of the UI.
